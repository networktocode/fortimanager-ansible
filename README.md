* **fortimgr_address_map**
  + Used to create, update, and delete an address object's device mapping configuration.
  + Returns the existing configuration for the address object and the configuration sent to the FortiManager API.
  + Lock, Save, and Unlock status are returned when locking the ADOM is set.
* **fortimgr_ip_pool**
  + Used to create, update, and delete ip pools.

* **fortimgr_policy**
  + Used to create, update, and delete policy entries.
  + Returns the existing configuration for the policy entry and the configuration sent to the FortiManager API.
  + The API call sent to move the policy entry is returned when the policy is not in the location specefied by the optional policy placement params.

# Installation

You need to perform **two** steps to start using these modules.

1. Ensure this repository is in your Ansible module search path.
2. Install Dependencies.

### Locate your search path
Here is how you can locate your search path:
```
$ ansible --version
ansible 2.1.1.0
  config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
  configured module search path = ???
```

If you already have a search path configured, clone the repo (see options below) while you are in your search path.

If you have a "default" or No search path shown, open the config file that is shown in the output above, here that is `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`.  In that file, you'll see these first few lines:
```
[defaults]

# some basic default values...

inventory      = /etc/ansible/hosts
library        = /home/ntc/projects/
```

Add a path for `library` that exists in this repository - this will become your search path. Validate it with `ansible --version` after you make the change.

### Clone the repo in your search path

```
$ git clone https://github.com/networktocode/fortimgr-ansible
```

As a quick test and sanity use `ansible-doc` on one of the modules before trying to use them in a playbook.  For example, try this:
```
$ ansible-doc fortimgr_facts
```

If that works, Ansible can find the modules and you can proceed to installing the dependencies below.

## Install Dependencies
```
$ cd fortimgr-ansible
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
